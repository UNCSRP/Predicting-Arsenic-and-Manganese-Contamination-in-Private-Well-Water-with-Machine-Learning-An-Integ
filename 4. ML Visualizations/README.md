# Confusion Matrix Figure (Figure 3)
  - Visualization of confusion matrix metrics from top performing supervised machine learning model across the use cases (SVM with a linear kernel)
# Variable Importance Plot (Figure 4)
  - Shows importance of each predictor from the top performing machine learning (ML) models (SVM with a linear kernel) for use case 1
# Decision Boundary Plot (Figure 5, S1, S2)
  - Visualization of two predictors to determine how well those variables could predict metal contamination
